# Code Quality Improvement Steps

## 1. Basic Code Organization

1. Create a proper folder structure:
   ```
   Please create the following folder structure and move files accordingly:
   - src/
     - models/       # For model-related code
     - components/   # For UI components
     - hooks/        # For React hooks
     - types/        # For TypeScript types
     - utils/        # For utility functions
     - config/       # For configuration
   ```

2. Create barrel exports:
   ```
   Please create index.ts files in each folder to export their contents, simplifying imports throughout the application.
   ```

3. Group constants:
   ```
   Please create a constants.ts file in the config folder and move all constants there, organizing them by domain (UI, API, Models, etc.).
   ```

## 2. Type System Improvements

1. Create message source enum:
   ```
   Please convert the message source string literals to a proper TypeScript enum and update all related types and usages.
   ```

2. Add error types:
   ```
   Please create a types/errors.ts file with proper error types for different scenarios (API, Model, Validation) and update error handling accordingly.
   ```

3. Simplify complex types:
   ```
   Please review and simplify the types in chat.ts, focusing on making them more maintainable and removing unnecessary complexity.
   ```

## 3. Error Handling

1. Standardize error messages:
   ```
   Please create a consistent error message format across the application and update all error throwing instances.
   ```

2. Add error logging:
   ```
   Please implement a simple error logging utility and use it consistently across the application.
   ```

3. Simplify error states:
   ```
   Please review and simplify error handling in the hooks, ensuring consistent error state management.
   ```

## 4. Component Simplification

1. Split ChatInput:
   ```
   Please split the ChatInput component into smaller, focused components:
   - TokenCounter
   - SendButton
   - MessageInput
   Update the main ChatInput to use these components.
   ```

2. Simplify message rendering:
   ```
   Please review and simplify the message rendering logic in ChatMessages and ChatMessage components, removing any duplicate code.
   ```

3. Optimize props:
   ```
   Please review and optimize component props, removing unnecessary props and using proper prop types.
   ```

## 5. Configuration Management

1. Centralize config:
   ```
   Please create a central configuration file that combines all app settings, model configs, and environment variables.
   ```

2. Validate config:
   ```
   Please add simple validation for configuration values to ensure required values are present and valid.
   ```

## 6. Testing Improvements

1. Create test utilities:
   ```
   Please create common test utilities for:
   - Message creation
   - Mock responses
   - Common test setup
   And update tests to use these utilities.
   ```

2. Simplify mocks:
   ```
   Please review and simplify mock implementations in tests, focusing on making them more maintainable and readable.
   ```

3. Update test organization:
   ```
   Please organize tests to match the new folder structure and ensure consistent test patterns across files.
   ```

## 7. State Management

1. Simplify hook state:
   ```
   Please review and simplify state management in hooks, focusing on reducing unnecessary state and updates.
   ```

2. Message state management:
   ```
   Please optimize message state handling in useChatModel, focusing on reducing complexity and improving performance.
   ```

## 8. UI/UX Simplification

1. Consolidate styles:
   ```
   Please create a shared styles file with common variables and utilities, and update component styles to use these shared resources.
   ```

2. Clean up CSS:
   ```
   Please review and remove unused styles, consolidate duplicate styles, and simplify complex style rules.
   ```

3. Responsive design:
   ```
   Please simplify responsive design implementation, focusing on maintainable breakpoints and consistent patterns.
   ```
